                                    In this project, various interventions are implemented in line with other programs to address both domestic and international human trafficking. Currently, the we have awareness program through community theatre in our project conducted in Iringa where domestic human trafficking is very high.

                                        We have also ongoing study project with the New York University - Marron Institute. This study focuses on Tanzania’s domestic worker sector, with a focus on individuals who travel abroad to engage in domestic work. This includesTanzanian’s who experienced forced labor in Oman, Pakistan, and India, among other nations. Researchers propose three two sites in Tanzania; Dar es Salaam Zanzibardue to their large population of domestic workers who have returned from working abroad.

										<p>
                                        Our choice of these two sites is supported by evidence of the prevalence of trafficking in both domestic and transnational settings. Zanzibar and Dar es Salaam are also found to be sources and transit points for transnational trafficking to the Middle East, India, Southern Africa and Europe.

                                        Researchers would like to explore both formal and informal channels in which individuals are recruited and obtain domestic work for prevalence estimation. While our primary focus is to test the empirical adequacies of two prevalence estimation methods, we are also keen on developing and cultivating local research capacity, particularly in designing and executing conventional as well as innovative sampling methods in the field.
